# Research Experience for Teachers (RET)

The CS3 Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program offers a valuable opportunity for K-12 STEM educators to engage in hands-on research within the context of smart streetscapes. This program aligns with CS3's commitment to fostering a deep understanding of technology and engineering concepts among educators. RET participants work closely with CS3 researchers from Columbia University and Lehman College, gaining firsthand experience in cutting-edge projects related to smart streetscapes and urban technology.

In addition to hands-on research experience, the program includes personal and professional development workshops and seminars focused on culturally inclusive pedagogy in the classroom, as well as community-impact driven research. Participants engage in the program for roughly 20 hours a week.

## Program Goals

1. Receive training in the fundamentals of smart streetscape technology through real-time, hyper-local streetscape applications built on advancements in edge-cloud technology, wireless-optical engineering, visual analytics, and computer security.
1. Acquire tools, experiences, and ongoing relationships with engineers, sociologists, and fellow STEM educators that will enable them to share with their students the latest developments in smart city technology and inspire students to learn more about STEM career paths.
1. Gain background and firsthand experience in the design, methods, and analysis of research associated with engineering.
1. Learn methods to implement culturally inclusive pedagogy in the classroom to better serve students.
