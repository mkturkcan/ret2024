## About

The CS3 Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program offers a valuable opportunity for K-12 STEM educators to engage in hands-on research within the context of smart streetscapes. This program aligns with CS3's commitment to fostering a deep understanding of technology and engineering concepts among educators. RET participants work closely with CS3 researchers from Columbia University and Lehman College, gaining firsthand experience in cutting-edge projects related to smart streetscapes and urban technology.

In addition to hands-on research experience, the program includes personal and professional development workshops and seminars focused on culturally inclusive pedagogy in the classroom, as well as community-impact driven research. Participants engage in the program for roughly 20 hours a week.
